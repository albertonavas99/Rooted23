Disrupting APTs with one line code. Active attacks to advanced stegomalware:

Many cybercriminal groups are employing very simple techniques (at least from an academic perspective) and known tools to circumvent perimeter defenses, although more advanced groups are also using steganography to hide C&C communication and data exfiltration. We argue that this lack of sophistication is not due to the lack of knowledge in steganography (some APTs have already experimented with advanced algorithms) but simply because organizations are not able to defend themselves, even against the simplest steganography techniques.
